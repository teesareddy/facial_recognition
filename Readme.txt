step:1
    Open this folder with vs code for efficent execution of the code
    This help to adopt the environment usefully
step 2:
    Now to run the provided code first we need to install the requirments so rather than installing everything line by line 
    we could choose a method to install all the packages at a time
    -> To install them open the vs code file editor then open requirments.txt in vs code
    -> Then in the top left choose terminal and opt for new temrinal
    -> now when the terminal opens carefully click type this command pip install -r requirments.txt
    -> This will take couple of time and installs all the packages 
    -> If you want to install all the packages individually i have provided a packages_used.txt file where everything is specified
step 3:
    -> Now simply run the python file using a vs-code or anyother environment and make sure that the trained model is the same directory where the python file is located
step 4:
    -> It will run if there are no packages missing else it would throw warnings and then run further 
    -> Its better to use a laptop or desktop with better camera quality since it is done throught camera
    -> once the image starts detection then the it automatically starts projecting the emotions on the screen
step 5:
    -> It is not recommended to directly close the live camera file , instead press 'q' button on the keyboard it would save the system resources
